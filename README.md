Cipher CLI Tool
==
The goal of this project is to implement encryption and decryption algorithms for strings.

## Installation
You can download & install the application use the following commands:
```bash
git clone REPOSITORY_URL
cd cipher-cli
composer install
```
## Running
The implementation now is ready to run via the following command:
```bash
php cipher
```
The tool will ask you for a string, algorithm and the method to encrypt or decrypt the given string. 

## TODO
1. (DONE) Implement Shift Encryption Algorithm (Caesar Cipher)
2. (DONE) Implement Matrix Encryption Algorithm (Hill Cipher)
3. (DONE) Write Unit Tests for both Shift and Matrix Algorithms
4. (DONE) Implement Decryption for both Shift and Matrix Algorithms
5. (DONE) Implement Command Line Tool
6. (DONE) Add Integration for Reverse Encrpyion Algorithm
7. (DONE) Add Reverse Encrpyion Algorithm for CLI Tool
